    <h1>Welcome to Front End Development Session</h1>
    <p>What is Front End Development?...</p>
    <p>Front-end development primarily focuses on user experience. Using the related coding and design techniques, you as front-end developers build the elements of an application that are directly accessed by end-users with a goal of rendering the entire interface elegant, easy to use, fast, and secure, fostering user engagement and interaction.</p>

    <p>Below are the most common programming languages for developing the front end.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScripts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Front-end development frameworks</p>

    <p>Front-end frameworks accord you ready-made code and components, such as prewritten standard functions packaged as libraries, with no need to build common functionality and components from scratch.</p>
